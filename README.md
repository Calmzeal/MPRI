# MPRI
The "secret" Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique
https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php

## Introduction
If you study computer science in France, donnot miss MPRI.
Behind the cutting-edge industries like air-bus, TGV and 
nuclear plants, the core sytsem is designed, written and
proved by french style assistants like Coq. Behind Coq,
stands Ocaml, a powerful programming language where calculations
are expressed by "set" and "arrow" from the category point 
of view,  in order that the number of states in Turing machine
could be dramataically reduced. In the end, litte code makes great 
sense.

The Ocaml team created this master.Quickly, many other 
distinguished names joined in the program, extending to Algo,
complexity, combination, optimization, language, proof, category,
verification strict and approximate, distributed philo, crypto,
non- Von Neumann calculation models including quantum information,
biology and molecular calculations.

## Mission
This repo aims to expose the french theoritical computer science
 to public, a domain who should be equally respected like AI,
 who could equally influence the whole industry in the near future.
 
## Plan and Organization
There will be a directory for each course. 
Please feel free to fork this repo to spread theoretical ideas.
